/**
 * usePartnerPackLocale — force the active partner pack's UI language.
 *
 * A partner pack declares a ``default_locale`` (batimatech-ca ships ``fr-CA``
 * for French Canada). When the pack is active the whole app should present in
 * that language. This hook applies the pack's normalized locale once per
 * activation: it switches i18next, persists the choice, and records a marker so
 * it does not fight a user who later picks a different language from the header.
 *
 * Deactivation is handled by ``PartnerPackDeactivateDialog`` calling
 * ``resetPackLocale`` (reverts to English and clears the marker), so toggling a
 * pack on then off leaves the language exactly where it started.
