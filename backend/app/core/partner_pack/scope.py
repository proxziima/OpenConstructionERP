"""Partner-pack project scoping helper.

When a pack is active, the workspace presents a single-client view: only
projects tagged ``metadata_["partner_pack"] == <slug>`` are shown, everywhere
projects are listed (the /projects page, the dashboard cards, the per-project
summary). Activation tags the pack's demo projects and any project created while
the pack is active; deactivation untags them so the normal listing returns.

This module is the single source of truth for "which pack scopes the workspace
right now", so every listing site applies the exact same rule. Every helper is
fail-soft: a partner-pack lookup error returns "no active pack", leaving the
caller's normal (un-scoped) query intact.
