"""v3105 — property_dev R6 multi-head merge.

R6 shipped property_dev expansion in two parallel migration files:

    v3103_propdev_lead_reservation_spa_schedule_parties   (Lead/SPA pipeline)
    v3104_propdev_broker_escrow_pricematrix_hierarchy     (Broker/Escrow/PriceMatrix/Phase/Block)

Both branched off ``v3102_round5_merge`` so the two feature waves could
land in parallel worktrees without serialising. This file consolidates
the two heads into a single linear head so ``alembic upgrade head`` is
deterministic on fresh installs and the production VPS stays single-trunk.

Pure merge — no schema changes.
