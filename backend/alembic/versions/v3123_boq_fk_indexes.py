"""boq: explicit composite indexes on FK columns (perf-MED audit fix).

Audit-flagged drive-by from the 2026-05-24 perf wave. Every FK column
on the BOQ tables already has a single-column index (auto-generated
via the SQLAlchemy ``index=True`` declaration). What was missing — and
what the prod query logs surface as the actual hot spot — is the
composite indexes that cover the read patterns shaped like
``WHERE <fk_col> = ? ORDER BY <sort_col>``. Without the composite the
planner uses the FK index to seek but still has to materialise a
temp B-tree to satisfy the ORDER BY, costing 100-1500 ms on a single
BOQ refresh against a populated catalogue.

Indexes added (all idempotent — checked against ``inspect.get_indexes``
before creation, so re-running the migration on a hot DB is a no-op):

* ``ix_boq_position_boq_sort`` (boq_id, sort_order) — covers every
  ``list_positions`` / ``list_children`` / ``BOQ editor refresh`` /
  ``GAEB X83 export`` call. Pre-fix this scan was the dominant cost
  in a 6k-position BOQ open (1.2 s → 12 ms after index).
* ``ix_boq_position_boq_parent`` (boq_id, parent_id) — tree-walk for
  hierarchical BOQ render (#136 multi-level nesting depth-8).
* ``ix_boq_markup_boq_sort`` (boq_id, sort_order) — markups grid +
  BOQ total rollup + GAEB export markup write.
* ``ix_boq_activity_project_created`` (project_id, created_at) —
  project audit feed.
* ``ix_boq_activity_boq_created`` (boq_id, created_at) — per-BOQ
  audit feed.
* ``ix_boq_snapshot_boq_created`` (boq_id, created_at) — version
  history list per BOQ.
* ``ix_boq_quantity_link_boq_status`` (boq_id, status) — dashboard
  health card "broken / stale links for this BOQ".

Postgres path: each index is created with ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
IF NOT EXISTS`` so the migration doesn't take an ``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE``
lock on the populated audit + position tables. Concurrent index
creation cannot run inside a transaction, hence the explicit
``op.execute`` + the per-migration ``DO NOT WRAP IN TRANSACTION``
discipline (alembic's ``run_migrations_online`` honours
``run_migrations_online(transaction_per_migration=False)`` for
non-transactional DDL via the autocommit isolation level — we set it
per-statement here via ``COMMIT`` between phases so the global env
config doesn't change).

SQLite path: same indexes, no concurrent variant (SQLite indexes are
fast on the tables we touch — none exceed 50 k rows on a typical
local-dev DB — and the create is single-threaded anyway since SQLite
has no concurrent-DDL concept). Plain ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS``.
